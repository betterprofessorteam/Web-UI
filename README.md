# Web-UI
The objective of the website is to create a landing page & about us page with the releveant information pertaining to Better Professor. This assignment was given during Build Week at Lambda School.

# Better Professor App
Students (from across cohorts and tracks) were asigned a group that had seperate jobs to do the project. My part was as a U.I. developer. 

#Landing Page
The landing page was done and designed based off the main yellow image. The page was built in a container in order to have an overall background image (at least for desktop). A gradient image was also used for the container as well. In the future, more images and icons would be more appealing for the landing page. This page is mobile and tablet responsive with max-width:500px & max-width: 800px respectively.

#About Us Page
The about us page didn't have too many instructions to begin with, making it flexible. I've decided to keep tha background image as the entire background an not add the gradient as a personal preference. But it should be noted that once the width reaches the tablet mode, the gradient image within the container will take over. In the future, perhaps it would be nice to have more images and integrate more flexbox in the following: 4 pillars and History. For History, in the future I plan to integrate a timeline with more dates! The about us page also contains a component titled (or under) `.navteam` and is working well. It has a .forEach that makes the .about class not display when opening the webpage. The option to click on the names was also added.
