            <h2>Company History</h2>
            <h3>The Ephiphany</h3>
            <p>Our founder and CEO, Jane Doe, was a marketing professor at the Stern School of Business as New York University before making a pivot towards entrepreneurship. She came up with the idea when she realized that she wanted to be a part time professor, but couldn't manage her time properly betwen family, startups, and teaching. After talking to many potentional invesotors and aquiring the necessary funding, Jane founded the company in mid 2015.</p>
            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p>We started off in the east coast, due to the high amount of universities. The conceptualization of the app came after 4 years of beta testing. This also aligned with the third-party evaluations done by teaching agencies.</p>
            <h3>Initial Public Offering</h3>
            <p>The I.P.O was held at the beginning of 2018 at $3 per share, and has been steadily rising quarter after quarter.</p>
            <h3>The Future Ahead</h3>
            <p>Since the launch of our Better Professor App, traffic to our site has tripled from 3,000 visits per day to a little over 9,000 visits per day. We have not excpicitly launched a marketing campaign, but we are well aware of the positive network effects that our product has had! We plan to expland to Europe in the coming year, so keep a look out for our Careers page.</p>
