            <p>A fan brush can be your best friend. I am gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue. In your world you have total and absolute power.</p> 
            <p>Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Even trees need a friend. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>
